# Plasma MVP Implementation in Vyper
This is an experimental implementation of [Minimal Viable Plasma](Minimum Viable Plasma) in Vyper.
The `root_chain` and `priority_queue` contracts are based on [OmiseGo's MVP implementation](https://github.com/omisego/plasma-mvp). `RootChainTest.js` are also based on OmiseGo's and `PriorityQueueTest.js` is taken from [FourthState's](https://github.com/FourthState/plasma-mvp-rootchain) with minor modifications. We appreciate their work.
